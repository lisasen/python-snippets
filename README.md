# Lisa’s Python Snippets  

Welcome to my stash of **generic Python code** — little helpers, utilities, and snippets I reuse across projects.  

Feel free to **clone, pull, and use** whatever you need.  
But please **don’t commit or push changes here** — this repo is read-only for everyone except me.  

---

## Why I Made This Repo  

I kept writing the same small pieces of Python code in different projects.  
This repo is my personal “toolbox” so I can:  
- keep my reusable code in one place  
- save time instead of rewriting from scratch  
- share snippets easily with others  

---

## How to Use  

Clone it:  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lisasen/python-snippets.git
```

Then just import what you need in your own projects:

```
from utils.date_helpers import parse_date
from utils.string_helpers import slugify
```
